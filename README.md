# Real time web

## Concept
My concept is a visualisation on popularity on twitter.
In my site users can enter a keyword/hashtag and it will return the tweets plotted on a map by location like a heatmap.
For example if the user uses #ajax before a football game the map will show where the most tweets about ajax are and update when someone tweets about it.


## API
The API I will be using is the twitter API.
Twitter uses a key that is linked to your twitter account and it has a [rate limit](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/ads/general/guides/rate-limiting.html) on 15 minute blocks.
